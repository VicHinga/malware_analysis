1. What is malware analysis:

Malware is any kind of computer software with malicious intent.
    • Spying on target
        ◦ RATs
        ◦ Key-loggers
          
    • Data ex-filtration: This is unauthorized transfer of data from a computer.
    • Data encryption and destruction
        ◦ Ransomware

Types of malware:
    • Trojans: Disguises itself as a legitimate application to do malicious activity (data ex filtration and spying e.g. Emotet)
    • RATs: This software allows an attacker to remotely access and execute commands on the system.
    • Ransomware: Software that encrypts all files on the system and holds data for ransom.
    • Dropper: Software that downloads and drop additional malware
    • File-less Malware: Makes changes to files that are native to the OS (Astaroth)



Malware analysis:
    • Extracting as much information as possible from a malicious software.
    • The information aids in understanding: 
        ◦ Functionality of the malware.
        ◦ How the system was infected (e.g. is it a phishing attack)
        ◦ How the malware communicates with the attacker
        ◦ How to defend against similar attacks by ex-filtrating useful indicators e.g. registry, URLs, keys and file names to generate signatures useful for future detection.



Types of Malware Analysis:
    • Static Analysis: Analysis without executing/running the malware (Extract strings, PE headers)
      
    • Dynamic Analysis: Analysis by executing/running to understand what the malware does during execution (Done in a debugger)
      
    • Code Analysis: Reverse engineering assembly code (Both Static and Dynamic) 
      
    • Behavioral Analysis:This is monitoring the malware after execution. To fully understand how the malware works. (Process monitoring, network monitoring, registry entry monitoring)

Static Analysis:
Analyze malware without executing it, aim is to extract useful information.

    1. Identify the file type:- Target OS, architecture and format(e.g. dll or exe)
       
    2. Identify the malware:- Generating a hash of the malware this gives the malware a unique identifier; using the hash to see if anyone else has analyzed the malware(disclosure site may reveal the identity of the malware). Check if the malware will change after execution in dynamic analysis.
       
    3. Strings:- Shows us how the malware sets up persistence, the CNC it connects to
       
    4. Packing and Obfuscation:- Unpacking and de-obfuscating the application to reveal the malware source code.
       
    5. PE Headers:-
